JWileymisc
========

An `R` package with general utility and convenience functions.
Some of these are general functions that help using and
exploring SEM style data.  Others are more specific.
This package has grown out of my own work, and is often to automate
repetitive tasks.

The PDF manual is available under /inst/doc/.

Installation
------------

```
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("JWiley/JWileymisc")
```

Examples
--------

I do not have any vignettes or demos for this package.
However, the functions are documented and I have included examples in the
function documentation that are relatively basic.
