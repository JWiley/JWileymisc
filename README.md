An `R` package with general utility and convenience functions.
Some of these are general functions that help using and
exploring SEM style data.  Others are more specific.
This package has grown out of my own work, and is often to automate
repetitive tasks. See the Vignettes, listed under the "Articles" menu
item for description and examples using some of the more interesting
functions from the package.
